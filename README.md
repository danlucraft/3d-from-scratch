3d from Scratch
===============

This is a project to write an Elite clone, in JavaScript, without reading any 
3d/2d graphics or game programming tutorials at all. I've got to figure everything
out myself. For fun.

Running
-------

Do:

    brew install yarn
    export PATH="$PATH:`yarn bin`"
    yarn install
    rake build

You can now open the files in demos.
