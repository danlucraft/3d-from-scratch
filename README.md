3d from Scratch
===============

This is a project to write an Elite clone, in JavaScript, without reading any 
3d/2d graphics or game programming tutorials at all. I've got to figure everything
out myself. For fun.

# Day One

Implemented pixel screen, line drawing, and a 3d cube you can move with cursor keys.
